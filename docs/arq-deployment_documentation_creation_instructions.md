# Deployment Documentation Template for Python Modules

This document describes the standard structure and content for the deployment instructions that your team should create for each module. **The content and information provided in this document are the most important. Focus on clearly describing the steps and necessary information. Formatting should be kept simple, just to make the document minimally readable. Aesthetic adjustments to the documents as a whole will be made later.**

Each module must contain a document following the pattern below, noting that the file name must have the following format:
```
[module_name]_deployment_doc.md
```
It is important to follow this naming standard exactly, as it will be used later by automated documentation management tools. This file should preferably be at the root of the repository.

## 1. Service Dependencies

- **Description**: List and describe all external dependencies that must be running for the module to function correctly (e.g., PostgreSQL server, Mosquitto broker, Redis server).

- **Reason**: Explain the reason for each dependency and what it does in the context of the module.

---

## 2. Environment Variables

- **Description**: List all the environment variables required for the module.

  Example:
  - **LOG_LEVEL**: System log level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN). Used to adjust the verbosity of the generated logs.
  - **DATABASE_URL**: Database connection URL. Used to define where the data will be stored.

- **Documentation**: For each variable, describe what it is used for and what its possible value options are. Include details about default values, if any.

## 3. Instructions to Build the Container

In this section, provide the commands necessary to create the module's Docker container. **Commands should be listed in order, with a clear explanation of what each one does and the expected result.**

### Example Commands:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/user/repository.git
   ```
   - **Explanation**: This command clones the Git repository to your local environment.
   - **Expected result**: The source code will be copied to the local directory.

2. **Set environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname
   ```
   - **Explanation**: Sets the environment variable with the database URL.
   - **Expected result**: The environment will be configured with the database credentials.

3. **Build the container**:
   ```bash
   docker buildx build . -t module_name:version
   ```
   - **Explanation**: Builds the Docker image for the module.
   - **Expected result**: A Docker image will be created with the specified tag.

## 4. Example Commands to Run the Container

Provide clear examples of how to run the generated Docker container.

### Example Command:
```bash
docker run -d --name module_name -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname module_name:version
```
- **Explanation**: Runs the module's container in the background, using the configured environment variables.
- **Expected result**: The container will be running and ready for use.

This document should be adapted according to the needs of each module but always following the guidelines established above to ensure consistency and clarity in the deployment instructions.
